        You will need to replicate the news page shown on this site. The page
        and API have been set up for you but you will need to fetch data from
        the API and display it in news card components.

        Hints:
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" paddingTop={2}>
        - You only need to modify the NewsGrid.tsx file.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" paddingTop={2}>
        - Use fetch to get data from the API and store the data via the React
        useState Hook
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" paddingTop={2}>
        - Use the React useEffect Hook so that data is requested from the API and stored on
        initial render of the news grid component
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" paddingTop={2}>
        - Map the stored data to the news card component
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" paddingTop={2}>
        - Look in the interfaces folder for information about the structure of
        the data requested from the API
      </Typography>
